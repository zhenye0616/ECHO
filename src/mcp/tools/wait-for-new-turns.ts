// V1.6 (item 030) — `wait_for_new_turns`: stateless long-poll for group session.
//
// Per founder direction (2026-05-09): "I should be able to link multiple
// sessions together and they tail each other... user should feel the unified
// context of all the tools and agents they use are unified and communicating
// with each other." This tool is the missing primitive that lets agents stay
// synchronized passively without a manual MCP call per turn.
//
// Stateless on every dimension (per item 027):
//   - No subscriber registry. No per-client state.
//   - Each call is independent — the storage poll is the only shared resource.
//   - No module-level mutable state in this file (asserted by spec §3 test).
//
// Source semantics (deliberately different from echo_resolve_mru's MRU pick):
//   - echo_resolve_mru(sources=[<source_app>]) → MRU exact-source resolution
//     for "where did I leave off" lookups.
//   - wait_for_new_turns(sources=[<source_app>]) → PREFIX match across ALL
//     sessions of that app (catches new Cursor composers, new CC sessions,
//     etc. as they spawn — group session A wants to wake on ANY new turn).
