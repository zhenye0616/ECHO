// Shared ISO-8601 timezone-marker check for the MCP retrieval tools.
//
// Originally lived in `src/mcp/tools/recent-work-context.ts` (exported as
// `hasTzMarker`), where it backed a single warning emitted when a caller
// passed a TZ-less ISO string. Lifted here so `search_memories` (and any
// future since/until-bearing tool) emits the same warning under the same
// rule. Surfaced by Gap 6 of the 2026-05-08 17:01 PDT v1.5-livetest:
// `search_memories` accepted `2026-05-06T00:00:00` (no Z) silently while
// `get_recent_work_context` warned. Inconsistent contract per tool is a
// foot-gun for clients on a non-UTC machine — the founder is PDT, so
// silent local-time parse drops or expands the window by 7 hours.

/** Returns the canonical warning string when an ISO timestamp lacks a TZ
 *  marker. Tools call this after schema validation but before the storage
 *  query, and push the result into their `warnings` array. Single string
 *  literal so consumers can grep for it across a multi-tool trace.
 *
 *  V1.5.7 polish (2026-05-09): prefixed with `[TZ]` so the warning is
 *  visually distinguishable from truncation/cap warnings when a busy
 *  response stacks several into `warnings[]`. The morning's resume call
 *  surfaced 3 warnings simultaneously (limit-dropped-clusters,
 *  storage-cap-hit, TZ-naive) and the TZ one was easy to miss. */
