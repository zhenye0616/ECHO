// Item 120 — worker heartbeat artifacts: the paired invariant for fail-closed
// workers. "Never crash the daemon" was adopted without its twin: a degraded or
// self-disabled worker must be externally OBSERVABLE. Each enrichment worker
// writes a small, atomically-overwritten heartbeat under `~/.echo/state/` at the
// end of every tick and on boot-time disable, so a stalled tick or an accidental
// disablement (the f19dc419 "zero signals for weeks" class) becomes queryable.
//
// This module is the whole contract item 117's doctor imports — path + type +
// worker-name constants only, no doctor coupling. No worker ever READS a
// heartbeat; writes are atomic overwrites, so a pre-existing malformed file
// cannot affect a worker.
