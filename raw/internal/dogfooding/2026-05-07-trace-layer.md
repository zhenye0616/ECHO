# Dogfooding journal — V1.5 trace layer (`get_recent_work_context`)

**Item shipped:** [`2026-05-06-018-recent-work-context-tool`](../../../backlog/complete/2026-05-06-018-recent-work-context-tool.md)
**Dogfooding window:** 2026-05-07 → ~2026-05-21 (2 weeks; extend if signal is thin)
**Sources active in store:** claude-code, codex, cursor, git
**Goal:** generate enough observations to know what V1.5+ should fix, what V2 should preserve, and whether item 017 (`search_memories` returning normalized atoms) is even needed.

## How to use this journal

Fill an entry **in the moment** when ECHO's `get_recent_work_context` either delights or disappoints. The cost should be ~30 seconds per entry — copy the template, jot a one-liner, move on. Aspirational entries written at end-of-week are useless; lossy in-the-moment entries are gold.

Codex, Claude Code, and any other AI client must log every ECHO MCP interaction here during this dogfooding window, including `get_recent_work_context`, `search_memories`, `echo_ping`, and equivalent local MCP/CLI calls. Multiple calls from one task may be grouped into one detailed entry if the inputs and observed results are all captured.

This journal is the **input**; the V1.5+ backlog items the strategist writes after the window are the **output**. Don't try to design fixes here — just observe.

## What to watch for (from item 018's "what V1.5 will teach us")

Use these as the prompts you scan against during the day:

| Signal category | Sounds like | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| **Artifact-identity policy joins** | "Two atoms reference the same file but ECHO split them into different clusters" | The canonical-id rule needs amendment (most likely a different fallback for some artifact type) |
| **4h window correctness** | "ECHO included Friday morning's work in Monday's cluster" or "ECHO split a coherent 6h thread" | Default window needs tuning; possibly per-source |
| **Label heuristic quality** | "The label said 'discussion about <random file>' which was misleading" | Heuristic needs work, or `label?` should be dropped from V1.5 |
| **Rank ordering vs gut** | "I expected the open-loop cluster first; ECHO ranked it third" | Tune ranking signals or add a new one |
| **Edge-kind sufficiency** | "Two atoms about the same idea but no shared artifact got split" | `temporal_near` / `same_conversation` edges might be needed in V1.5.1 |
| **AI client uptake** | "Claude in Cursor responded better / worse / not differently when the trace was available" | Validates whether the contract is right |
| **Latency** | "I waited" or "felt instant" | 500ms p95 SLO holds or doesn't |
| **Open-loop hint quality** | "ECHO surfaced an 'open question' that was actually closed" | Atom-level hint regex too greedy; or hint-resolution work moved up from V2 |
| **Source-diversity bias** | "All 12 atoms were Cursor; the matching Claude Code session was missing" | Storage query may need ordering; or normalizer dropped events silently |

If something happens that doesn't fit any of these, **make a new category and call it out** — that's the highest-signal observation.

## Daily entries

### 2026-05-07 — dogfooding day 1

> **Timezone convention:** all times in this journal are **founder's local time (PDT, America/Los_Angeles)** unless explicitly noted. Source data (CaptureEvent timestamps, MCP responses) stores ISO 8601 UTC; entries here are converted on write.

#### 2026-05-07 01:08 PDT — first call wedged the consumer's context budget

- **Trigger:** founder asked "check my echo mcp and see if you can know what codex is currently working on." Claude Code session called `get_recent_work_context` with no args.
- **Query inputs:** all defaults (since = now − 4h, until = now, no artifact_hint, limit = 100).
- **Returned:** 3 clusters, 40 atoms, top cluster "discussion about Project_echo" (rank_reasons: `["recent_activity", "dense"]`). Total response: **454,871 chars**.
- **Verdict:** ❌ wrong — response was too big to even read. Tool result handler refused the payload.
- **Note:** trace algorithm was correct (clustering, ranking, rank_reasons all looked right in the saved file). The bug is **payload representation, not clustering**. Forensic analysis: 97% of edges in the dominant 36-atom cluster were redundant (restated cluster anchors); 48% of per-atom bytes were inline `action.input`/`action.output` text.
- **Conjecture:** drop edges whose shared artifacts are all `scope` or `session` role; add opt-in `format: 'minimal'` for atom-content truncation. Specced as item 019. Forensic data preserved at `raw/internal/dogfooding/2026-05-07-trace-response-sample/`.

#### 2026-05-07 15:39 PDT — first end-to-end success; sub-minute capture latency

- **Trigger:** founder asked "can you see me and codex convo in the past 5 mins" — testing whether ECHO actually captures live activity.
- **Query inputs:** `search_memories` (not `get_recent_work_context`) with `source_prefix: 'fs:/Users/zhenye/.codex/'`, `limit: 10`. Used the targeted retrieval to dodge the 019-blocked bloat.
- **Returned:** 10 events; the most recent turn-pair was timestamped 15:39:34 PDT, ~7 minutes before the query at 15:46 PDT. Recovered the full prompt + assistant response.
- **Verdict:** ✅ right — capture pipeline + retrieval are working end-to-end.
- **Note:** sub-minute capture latency from codex's JSONL append → SQLite. The conversation codex was having (about whether V1 schema supports non-git work like Google Docs / Salesforce deals) **independently validated the V1 design** — codex's framing converged with what we locked in items 016/018 (open vocabulary, `state.snapshot`/`state.delta`, work-object inferred at trace layer). Two reasoning processes converging from different starts ≈ structural correctness signal.
- **Conjecture:** none for this observation. Worth tracking longitudinally whether other independent design conversations land on similar primitives — that's repeatable validation.

#### 2026-05-07 15:56 PDT — one-hour cross-platform context retrieval from Codex

- **Trigger:** founder clarified "we are currently on V1.5 use ECHO MCP and read into Claude for better context; limit the time window to the past one hour." Codex called `get_recent_work_context` directly through ECHO MCP to pull the last hour into context.
- **Query inputs:** `since=2026-05-07T21:56:33.000Z` (14:56 PDT), `until=2026-05-07T22:56:33.000Z` (15:56 PDT), `artifact_hint=null`, `limit=100`.
- **Returned:** 2 clusters, 21 atoms; top cluster had no `label`, anchors `Project_echo`, Claude Code conversation `684f37f7...`, and `backlog/ready/2026-05-07-019-trace-edge-filter-and-format.md`; rank_reasons: `["recent_activity", "has_open_loop", "dense"]`.
- **Verdict:** 🟡 partial — the retrieval found the right recent work across surfaces, but the response still carried the pre-019 dense edge payload.
- **Note:** this is the V1.5 loop working in miniature: Codex used ECHO MCP to recover recent Claude Code implementation context for item 019 plus the active Codex design conversation, without the founder manually pasting either thread. The one-hour window felt like the right scope for "what is happening right now" context.
- **Conjecture:** after 019 is merged/restarted, repeat the same one-hour call with default `format: 'full'` and then opt-in `format: 'minimal'` to compare whether Claude/Codex gets the same orientation with less payload.

#### 2026-05-07 16:15 PDT — false-negative: edge filter "didn't work" because daemon was stale

- **Trigger:** post-019-merge dogfooding. Claude Code called `get_recent_work_context` with the same one-hour window (`22:00 → 23:00 UTC`).
- **Query inputs:** `since=2026-05-07T22:00:00.000Z`, `until=2026-05-07T23:00:00.000Z`, defaults otherwise.
- **Returned:** 2 clusters, 24 atoms. Total response 163,060 chars (already 64% smaller than yesterday's 454K, so something improved). BUT cluster 1 had 91 edges = K_14 (100% of pairs), cluster 2 had 45 edges = K_10. Surviving edges all had only `conversation` + `repo` artifacts — exactly the case 019's predicate should drop. `query.format` echoed `null` instead of `'full'`.
- **Verdict:** ❌ wrong — looked like the predicate was broken.
- **Note:** **the daemon was stale.** PID 59875 had been running since 01:04 PDT this morning (14+ hours); 019's code shipped at 15:51 PDT. `vite-node` hot-loads from source files but only at process start. **Same pattern as post-018 yesterday** — the merge commit didn't auto-restart the daemon.
- **Conjecture:** worth documenting daemon restart as a standard step in `merge-and-cleanup`, OR adding a launchd `WatchPaths` entry on `src/` so launchd restarts the process on code changes. Filed as a meta-observation below — not a backlog item yet; want to see if it recurs.

#### 2026-05-07 16:16 PDT — post-restart: edge filter validated

- **Trigger:** restarted daemon via `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.echo.daemon`. New PID 41940. Repeated identical query.
- **Query inputs:** identical to 16:15 (`22:00 → 23:00 UTC`, defaults).
- **Returned:** 2 clusters, 24 atoms (same membership). Total response 126,473 chars (**72% smaller than yesterday baseline**). Cluster 1: 91 → **2 edges** (97.8% drop). Cluster 2: 45 → **0 edges** (100% drop). Both surviving edges in cluster 1 carry at least one `file` artifact. `query.format` echoes `'full'`.
- **Verdict:** ✅ right — predicate works exactly as 019 specified.
- **Note:** the byte distribution shifted as predicted: `clusters[]` collapsed from 170KB → 4.5KB (97% drop), making `atoms[]` now 99.3% of payload. The brainstorm prediction (97% redundant edges) matched live data within 1pp. **Edge work was overstated as half the bloat — in reality, edges were the easy half; atom envelope is the dominant half and untouched by 019.**

#### 2026-05-07 16:16 PDT — `format: 'minimal'` validated

- **Trigger:** same query, opt-in `format: 'minimal'`.
- **Query inputs:** identical to 16:16-prior plus `format: 'minimal'`.
- **Returned:** 2 clusters, 24 atoms. Total response **64,006 chars (86% smaller than yesterday baseline)**. `query.format` echoes `'minimal'`. 8 of 24 atoms had `action.input` truncated; all 24 had `action.output` truncated (long assistant turns). Truncation suffix verbatim per spec: `"… [truncated; 1707 chars omitted; fetch full atom via search_memories]"`.
- **Verdict:** ✅ right — minimal mode caps content, leaves all other fields unchanged, suffix carries the fetch hint.
- **Note:** even at 64K, **still over Claude Code's tool-result context budget** (the harness saved to disk again). The reduction is real but the bottleneck has moved: with edges already optimal, the 99.3% of payload that's atom-envelope (artifacts, provenance, conversation refs, source, time, actors) sets the floor. `format: 'minimal'` only attacks the content blob inside atoms; it doesn't shrink the envelope itself.

---

**Round 2 themes (post-019):**

- **Edge filter is fully effective** — predicate matched the brainstorm prediction within 1pp on live data.
- **`format: 'minimal'` is fully effective** at what it targets — long content blobs — but the per-atom envelope (~3-4KB of structural metadata) is now the floor, not the content.
- **Atom envelope is the next bottleneck.** Edge optimization (B) would save maybe 4KB from already-small `clusters[]`. The bigger lever is some form of "atom-id-only" mode where consumer fetches selected atoms via `search_memories(id=…)` only when needed.
- **Daemon-restart-after-merge is a recurring pattern** (yesterday post-018, today post-019). First post-merge call silently runs on stale code → looks like the patch didn't ship. Worth a small follow-up: either `WatchPaths` in `com.echo.daemon.plist` or a step in `merge-and-cleanup` that calls `launchctl kickstart -k`.
- **Smoke script has a SIGPIPE bug** introduced by 019's edge-filter assertion (python `sys.exit(0)` early-exits before consuming all stdin → upstream `printf` fails under `set -o pipefail`). Trivial fix: `sys.stdin.read()` first, then process.
- The brainstorm's framing of A/B/C ordering needs a small adjustment in light of the real bottleneck: B (`shared_artifacts[]`) becomes lower-priority because edges are already small; a hypothetical D (atom-skeleton-only mode) becomes the high-leverage move.

**Decision (founder, 2026-05-07 16:19 PDT):** no changes for now. Keep dogfooding; collect interaction patterns; revisit the prioritization once we have ~1 week of real-use observations.

#### 2026-05-07 16:22 PDT — Codex asks ECHO what Claude just changed

- **Trigger:** founder asked Codex: "use echo to see the recent changes done by claude."
- **Query inputs:** `search_memories(query="claude recent changes Project_echo", source_prefix="claude", limit=10)` returned 0; `search_memories(query="Project_echo", source_prefix="cc", limit=20)` returned 0; `search_memories(source_prefix="cc", limit=20)` returned 0; `search_memories(query="Claude Code", limit=20)` returned 1 Codex memory that revealed the real Claude prefix; `search_memories(source_prefix="fs:/Users/zhenye/.claude/", limit=20)` returned the recent Claude project events.
- **Returned:** final Claude-prefix query returned 20 matches. Top meaningful event was the Claude Code turn at `2026-05-07T23:20:09Z` / 16:20 PDT in session `684f37f7...`, referencing `raw/internal/dogfooding/2026-05-07-trace-layer.md`. It said Claude logged round-2 dogfooding observations, added three entries plus "Round 2 themes", recorded "no changes for now", and left the journal uncommitted.
- **Verdict:** right — ECHO found the recent Claude work, but only after broadening past the guessed `claude` / `cc` prefixes to the captured filesystem source prefix.
- **Note:** prefix discovery is still awkward. The useful answer was there, but the source-prefix taxonomy is not obvious to an AI client without either prior memory or a fallback broad query.

#### 2026-05-07 16:33 PDT — Codex repeats Claude lookup using only trace clustering

- **Trigger:** founder asked Codex to find what Claude had been doing today using ECHO MCP, with the hard constraint: do not use `search_memories`; only use `get_recent_work_context`.
- **Query inputs:** three `get_recent_work_context(format="minimal")` calls: full local day `2026-05-07T07:00:00Z → 2026-05-08T07:00:00Z`, narrowed afternoon `2026-05-07T21:00:00Z → 2026-05-08T07:00:00Z`, and middle-day gap `2026-05-07T08:30:00Z → 2026-05-07T21:00:00Z`.
- **Returned:** full-day query returned 2 clusters / 23 atoms, top cluster all `claude_code` around `Project_echo` from 00:06-01:28 PDT. Afternoon query returned 3 clusters / 42 atoms, top cluster 25 `claude_code` atoms around `Project_echo` from 15:03-16:26 PDT. Middle-day query returned 2 clusters / 7 atoms, top cluster 2 `claude_code` atoms around `Echo_Extension` / `echo_gateway/src/privacy.ts` from 11:10-11:15 PDT.
- **Verdict:** right — trace clustering alone was enough to reconstruct the main Claude work threads, and the narrower windows fixed the full-day ranking blind spot.
- **Note:** this is a better interaction pattern than source-prefix guessing. The tradeoff is that `get_recent_work_context` needs time-window iteration when the day contains multiple unrelated work threads; otherwise top-ranked clusters can hide later activity.

---

**Round 3 themes (cross-AI handoff + tool framing):**

The 16:22 (codex via `search_memories`) and 16:33 (codex via `get_recent_work_context` only) entries together form a controlled experiment with hard signal:

- **Hypothesis A confirmed: the trace tool reaches the answer when constrained to it.** Yesterday's brainstorm flagged that codex chose `search_memories` for "what is X doing" questions and asked whether `get_recent_work_context` was structurally able to answer — the founder ran the test, codex succeeded. The fix is in **tool description framing**, not the tool itself: the description currently frames `get_recent_work_context` as "what was *I* doing" rather than "what was *anyone* doing." A line about `cluster.source_breakdown` answering source-anchored queries would have routed codex correctly on the first attempt.
- **Hypothesis 2 (independent of A): `search_memories` source-prefix taxonomy is opaque.** Codex's first session (15:10 session, see 16:22 entry) needed 5 attempts because it guessed `claude` / `cc` as logical lane names. ECHO's storage uses literal filesystem-prefix-encoded `source` strings (e.g., `fs:/Users/zhenye/.claude/`). The tool description gives no example. Codex recovered only because a *prior captured Codex session* had recorded the right prefix — ECHO self-healed via its own ledger, but a fresh install with no prior captures couldn't.
- **New observation surfaced: long time windows + default `limit=100` truncate to single dense cluster.** Codex's full-day call returned only the early-morning Project_echo cluster; afternoon Claude work was missing. Codex worked around it by splitting the day into morning / midday / afternoon bands. **The truncation strategy (drop lowest-rank atoms first) silently loses entire clusters** when the time window contains multiple disjoint work threads. There's no warning to the consumer; codex had to *notice* the missing afternoon work and iterate. Failure mode candidates: (a) higher default `limit` for wider windows, (b) truncate by clusters rather than atoms, (c) explicit warning in `response.warnings` when clusters were dropped, (d) a hint in the tool description recommending narrower windows for >12h queries.
- **Cross-AI compliance held for 3 rounds.** Codex independently logged 16:22 and 16:33; the journal-discipline line added at 13:xx PDT propagated correctly. First operational evidence that "all AI clients log every ECHO MCP interaction" works in practice.
- **The 3-call workaround pattern is itself a signal.** Splitting a day into ~10-hour bands to fit within `limit=100` is fine once but expensive at scale (3× round-trips, 3× model thinking turns). If this becomes a habitual pattern across queries, the tool should help — either by surfacing the truncation explicitly or by changing the default.

**Cumulative observation count (day 1):** 6 entries spanning 4 distinct AI clients (Claude Code, Codex 15:10 session, Codex 16:21 session, founder via Cursor not yet captured) and 3 tools (`search_memories`, `get_recent_work_context`, `echo_ping` indirectly). Strong signal for ~24 hours of dogfooding; pace suggests the 2-week window will produce 50-100 entries if the pattern holds.

---

**Day 1 themes so far:**
- The trace algorithm is doing its job (clustering, ranking, time-windowing, hint enrichment).
- The wire-format / payload sizing is wrong; 019 fixes it.
- Capture latency feels effectively real-time at the founder's traffic level.
- The V1 atom design is holding up under independent stress-testing.
- A one-hour `get_recent_work_context` window is enough to orient an AI client to the active cross-platform thread without asking the founder for a recap.

The `format: 'minimal'` parallel observation track will start once 019 ships. For now: the workaround is to use `search_memories` with `source_prefix` to bypass the trace tool's bloat, which works fine for "what's codex doing right now" type queries but doesn't exercise the cross-tool-clustering value V1.5 is supposed to deliver.

## Aggregated learnings (filled at end of window)

*To be written by the founder + strategist together at end of window. Sections to cover:*

- **What's the trace layer's actual hit rate** (% of calls that returned the right cluster) on a representative sample
- **Most common failure modes** (ranked by frequency and severity)
- **Surprises** (positive and negative — things we didn't predict in item 018's spec)
- **Whether the founder's daily workflow felt different** (the V1.5 north star)
- **Whether Claude-in-Cursor used the graph** vs ignored it
- **Whether item 017 is needed** based on real use, or if `get_recent_work_context` makes `search_memories` mostly redundant

## Recommendations / candidate V1.5+ backlog items

*Filled at end of window. Each candidate item should name:*

- The observation it's responding to (link to the daily entry/entries)
- The proposed change (algorithm / shape / config)
- Estimated cost
- Whether it's a minor tune (V1.5.1) or a structural change (V1.6 / V2)

## Notes on running this journal

- Entries with **only** a one-line note are fine. Don't gate on having a conjecture.
- Negative observations are more valuable than positive ones for V1.5+ planning. Don't filter.
- Screenshots / paste of MCP responses welcome — drop them inline as code blocks.
- If the founder forgets and skips a day, no problem. Quality of entries beats coverage.
- This file is not a backlog item — `tools/blocked.py` will not pick it up.
