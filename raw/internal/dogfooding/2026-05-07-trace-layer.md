# Dogfooding journal — V1.5 trace layer (`get_recent_work_context`)

**Item shipped:** [`2026-05-06-018-recent-work-context-tool`](../../../backlog/complete/2026-05-06-018-recent-work-context-tool.md)
**Dogfooding window:** 2026-05-07 → ~2026-05-21 (2 weeks; extend if signal is thin)
**Sources active in store:** claude-code, codex, cursor, git
**Goal:** generate enough observations to know what V1.5+ should fix, what V2 should preserve, and whether item 017 (`search_memories` returning normalized atoms) is even needed.

## How to use this journal

Fill an entry **in the moment** when ECHO's `get_recent_work_context` either delights or disappoints. The cost should be ~30 seconds per entry — copy the template, jot a one-liner, move on. Aspirational entries written at end-of-week are useless; lossy in-the-moment entries are gold.

Codex, Claude Code, and any other AI client must log every ECHO MCP interaction here during this dogfooding window, including `get_recent_work_context`, `search_memories`, `echo_ping`, and equivalent local MCP/CLI calls. Multiple calls from one task may be grouped into one detailed entry if the inputs and observed results are all captured.

This journal is the **input**; the V1.5+ backlog items the strategist writes after the window are the **output**. Don't try to design fixes here — just observe.

## Quick-fill observation template

Copy this block when adding an entry. **All times are local (PDT, America/Los_Angeles)** — convert from raw ISO 8601 UTC on write so the journal reads naturally on the founder's machine.

```
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM PDT — <one-line context>
- **Trigger:** what I (or Cursor's Claude) just did that called the tool
- **Query inputs:** since=…  until=…  artifact_hint=…
- **Returned:** N clusters, M atoms; top cluster: "<label or none>"; rank_reasons: […]
- **Verdict:** ✅ right / 🟡 partial / ❌ wrong
- **Note:** one-line observation — what felt right or off
- **Conjecture:** (optional) what algorithm/config change might help
```

## What to watch for (from item 018's "what V1.5 will teach us")

Use these as the prompts you scan against during the day:

| Signal category | Sounds like | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| **Artifact-identity policy joins** | "Two atoms reference the same file but ECHO split them into different clusters" | The canonical-id rule needs amendment (most likely a different fallback for some artifact type) |
| **4h window correctness** | "ECHO included Friday morning's work in Monday's cluster" or "ECHO split a coherent 6h thread" | Default window needs tuning; possibly per-source |
| **Label heuristic quality** | "The label said 'discussion about <random file>' which was misleading" | Heuristic needs work, or `label?` should be dropped from V1.5 |
| **Rank ordering vs gut** | "I expected the open-loop cluster first; ECHO ranked it third" | Tune ranking signals or add a new one |
| **Edge-kind sufficiency** | "Two atoms about the same idea but no shared artifact got split" | `temporal_near` / `same_conversation` edges might be needed in V1.5.1 |
| **AI client uptake** | "Claude in Cursor responded better / worse / not differently when the trace was available" | Validates whether the contract is right |
| **Latency** | "I waited" or "felt instant" | 500ms p95 SLO holds or doesn't |
| **Open-loop hint quality** | "ECHO surfaced an 'open question' that was actually closed" | Atom-level hint regex too greedy; or hint-resolution work moved up from V2 |
| **Source-diversity bias** | "All 12 atoms were Cursor; the matching Claude Code session was missing" | Storage query may need ordering; or normalizer dropped events silently |

If something happens that doesn't fit any of these, **make a new category and call it out** — that's the highest-signal observation.

## Daily entries

### 2026-05-07 — dogfooding day 1

> **Timezone convention:** all times in this journal are **founder's local time (PDT, America/Los_Angeles)** unless explicitly noted. Source data (CaptureEvent timestamps, MCP responses) stores ISO 8601 UTC; entries here are converted on write.

#### 2026-05-07 01:08 PDT — first call wedged the consumer's context budget

- **Trigger:** founder asked "check my echo mcp and see if you can know what codex is currently working on." Claude Code session called `get_recent_work_context` with no args.
- **Query inputs:** all defaults (since = now − 4h, until = now, no artifact_hint, limit = 100).
- **Returned:** 3 clusters, 40 atoms, top cluster "discussion about Project_echo" (rank_reasons: `["recent_activity", "dense"]`). Total response: **454,871 chars**.
- **Verdict:** ❌ wrong — response was too big to even read. Tool result handler refused the payload.
- **Note:** trace algorithm was correct (clustering, ranking, rank_reasons all looked right in the saved file). The bug is **payload representation, not clustering**. Forensic analysis: 97% of edges in the dominant 36-atom cluster were redundant (restated cluster anchors); 48% of per-atom bytes were inline `action.input`/`action.output` text.
- **Conjecture:** drop edges whose shared artifacts are all `scope` or `session` role; add opt-in `format: 'minimal'` for atom-content truncation. Specced as item 019. Forensic data preserved at `raw/internal/dogfooding/2026-05-07-trace-response-sample/`.

#### 2026-05-07 15:39 PDT — first end-to-end success; sub-minute capture latency

- **Trigger:** founder asked "can you see me and codex convo in the past 5 mins" — testing whether ECHO actually captures live activity.
- **Query inputs:** `search_memories` (not `get_recent_work_context`) with `source_prefix: 'fs:/Users/zhenye/.codex/'`, `limit: 10`. Used the targeted retrieval to dodge the 019-blocked bloat.
- **Returned:** 10 events; the most recent turn-pair was timestamped 15:39:34 PDT, ~7 minutes before the query at 15:46 PDT. Recovered the full prompt + assistant response.
- **Verdict:** ✅ right — capture pipeline + retrieval are working end-to-end.
- **Note:** sub-minute capture latency from codex's JSONL append → SQLite. The conversation codex was having (about whether V1 schema supports non-git work like Google Docs / Salesforce deals) **independently validated the V1 design** — codex's framing converged with what we locked in items 016/018 (open vocabulary, `state.snapshot`/`state.delta`, work-object inferred at trace layer). Two reasoning processes converging from different starts ≈ structural correctness signal.
- **Conjecture:** none for this observation. Worth tracking longitudinally whether other independent design conversations land on similar primitives — that's repeatable validation.

#### 2026-05-07 15:56 PDT — one-hour cross-platform context retrieval from Codex

- **Trigger:** founder clarified "we are currently on V1.5 use ECHO MCP and read into Claude for better context; limit the time window to the past one hour." Codex called `get_recent_work_context` directly through ECHO MCP to pull the last hour into context.
- **Query inputs:** `since=2026-05-07T21:56:33.000Z` (14:56 PDT), `until=2026-05-07T22:56:33.000Z` (15:56 PDT), `artifact_hint=null`, `limit=100`.
- **Returned:** 2 clusters, 21 atoms; top cluster had no `label`, anchors `Project_echo`, Claude Code conversation `684f37f7...`, and `backlog/ready/2026-05-07-019-trace-edge-filter-and-format.md`; rank_reasons: `["recent_activity", "has_open_loop", "dense"]`.
- **Verdict:** 🟡 partial — the retrieval found the right recent work across surfaces, but the response still carried the pre-019 dense edge payload.
- **Note:** this is the V1.5 loop working in miniature: Codex used ECHO MCP to recover recent Claude Code implementation context for item 019 plus the active Codex design conversation, without the founder manually pasting either thread. The one-hour window felt like the right scope for "what is happening right now" context.
- **Conjecture:** after 019 is merged/restarted, repeat the same one-hour call with default `format: 'full'` and then opt-in `format: 'minimal'` to compare whether Claude/Codex gets the same orientation with less payload.

---

**Day 1 themes so far:**
- The trace algorithm is doing its job (clustering, ranking, time-windowing, hint enrichment).
- The wire-format / payload sizing is wrong; 019 fixes it.
- Capture latency feels effectively real-time at the founder's traffic level.
- The V1 atom design is holding up under independent stress-testing.
- A one-hour `get_recent_work_context` window is enough to orient an AI client to the active cross-platform thread without asking the founder for a recap.

The `format: 'minimal'` parallel observation track will start once 019 ships. For now: the workaround is to use `search_memories` with `source_prefix` to bypass the trace tool's bloat, which works fine for "what's codex doing right now" type queries but doesn't exercise the cross-tool-clustering value V1.5 is supposed to deliver.

## Aggregated learnings (filled at end of window)

*To be written by the founder + strategist together at end of window. Sections to cover:*

- **What's the trace layer's actual hit rate** (% of calls that returned the right cluster) on a representative sample
- **Most common failure modes** (ranked by frequency and severity)
- **Surprises** (positive and negative — things we didn't predict in item 018's spec)
- **Whether the founder's daily workflow felt different** (the V1.5 north star)
- **Whether Claude-in-Cursor used the graph** vs ignored it
- **Whether item 017 is needed** based on real use, or if `get_recent_work_context` makes `search_memories` mostly redundant

## Recommendations / candidate V1.5+ backlog items

*Filled at end of window. Each candidate item should name:*

- The observation it's responding to (link to the daily entry/entries)
- The proposed change (algorithm / shape / config)
- Estimated cost
- Whether it's a minor tune (V1.5.1) or a structural change (V1.6 / V2)

## Notes on running this journal

- Entries with **only** a one-line note are fine. Don't gate on having a conjecture.
- Negative observations are more valuable than positive ones for V1.5+ planning. Don't filter.
- Screenshots / paste of MCP responses welcome — drop them inline as code blocks.
- If the founder forgets and skips a day, no problem. Quality of entries beats coverage.
- This file is not a backlog item — `tools/blocked.py` will not pick it up.
